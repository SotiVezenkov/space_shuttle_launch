# space_shuttle_launch
I have left quite a bit of comments, but better to be safe than sorry, so Ill add a few lines here aswell.
When the program is asking for data, we already have files in the ./WeatherData directory, if you have your own directory with files, please feel free to simply copy the path.
The email address from which you are sending the data should be email@outlook.com(the outlook.com part is really necessary).
Thank you for reading all of this, hope this project meets all your expectations - Soti
