# space_shuttle_launch
I have left quite a bit of comments, but better to be safe than sorry, so Ill add a few lines here aswell.
When the program is asking for data, we already have files in the ./WeatherData directory, if you have your own directory with files, please feel free to simply copy the path.
The email address from which you are sending the data should be email@outlook.com(the outlook.com part is really necessary). Also you may find that instead of Yes/No in the weather data csv files 
im using True and False I really am sorry for this inconvenience, but i simply could not make it work with Yes/No. 
Thank you for reading all of this, hope this project meets all your expectations - Soti
